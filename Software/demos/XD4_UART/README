------------------------------------------

DEMONSTRATES
------------

UART, Interrupts, LCD.



DESCRIPTION
-----------

Prints text that is received by the serial port to the LCD screen. The
screen has a blinking cursor which is toggled by the timer interrupt.
The UART utilizes a hardware interrupt to notify the processor of incoming
data. The backspace key moves the cursor backward one character.

Connect to the FPGA using 115200 Baud, 1 stop bit, no parity, and no flow
control. Use a program such as Minicom in Linux or Putty in Windows.



BUILDING AND RUNNING
--------------------

To compile, enter the 'bin' directory and update the paths in the Makefile.
Then run 'make' from within the same directory. Use the XUM bootloader to
send the resulting .xum file to the FPGA.
