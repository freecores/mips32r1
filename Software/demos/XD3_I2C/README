Uses the I2C main bus on the XUPV5 FPGA to read and display the temperature
from the onboard hardware monitor chip and from the FPGA.

To compile, enter the 'bin' directory and update the paths in the Makefile.
Then run 'make' from within the same directory. Use the XUM bootloader to
send the resulting .xum file to the FPGA.
